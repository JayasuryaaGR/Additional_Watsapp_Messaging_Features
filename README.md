# Additional_Watsapp_Messaging_Features

In Watsapp, we can only create a Message and Delete a Message(that too within a certain Time Limit). Here, along with those prevailing features, I have extended this concept
and added a new feature called 'MODIFICATION'. With this, we can modify an errored message. This feature will be very useful if we want to modify an already sent message and
if series of messages were sent after that particular message.

I have done this using Singly Linked List.
