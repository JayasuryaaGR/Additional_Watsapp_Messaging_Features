# Additional_Watsapp_Messaging_Features

In Watsapp, we can only create a Message and Delete a Message(that too within a certain Time Limit). Here, along with those prevailing features, I have extended this concept
and added a new feature called 'MODIFICATION'. With this, we can modify an errored message. This feature will be very useful if we want to modify an already sent message and
if series of messages were sent after that particular message.

I have done this using Singly Linked List.



Structure of this Program:
•	We can Post a new Message
•	We can Delete the last Message
•	We can Delete the very First Message
•	We can Delete any Message by giving its number as input.
•	We can Delete any Message by exactly typing it as the input.
•	We can Modify the last Message
•	We can Modify the very First Message.
•	We can Modify any Other Message by denoting its number.
•	We can Modify any Message by exactly typing the previous Unmodified one.
•	We can Display the Message.
